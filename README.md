# Data Structure Codes in C++

This repository contains various Data Structure implementations in C++. These codes were implemented during my semester to learn and practice the concepts of Data Structures. Each folder in the repository corresponds to a different Data Structure, and the code files inside the folders demonstrate the implementation of that specific Data Structure.

## Introduction

Data Structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science and play a crucial role in organizing and managing data efficiently. This repository serves as a collection of various Data Structure implementations in C++. It provides a valuable resource for learning and understanding the concepts of Data Structures through practical examples.

## Data Structures Included

The repository includes the following Data Structures:

1. **Linked List**: Implementation of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
2. **Stack**: Implementation of stack using arrays and linked lists.
3. **Queue**: Implementation of queue using arrays and linked lists.
4. **Binary Tree**: Implementation of binary search tree (BST) and traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
5. **Graph**: Implementation of graph using adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
6. **Operations on an Array**: Implementation of Different oprations on an array Like(**Sorting**, **Deletion**, **Insertion**, **Reverse**, **Search**).
   
Each Data Structure folder contains the C++ code files and a brief explanation of the implementation.

## How to Use

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the folder of the Data Structure you want to explore.
3. Open the C++ code files using any text editor or C++ IDE.
4. Study the code and comments to understand the implementation details.
5. Compile and run the code to see the Data Structure in action.

Feel free to modify the code or use it as a reference for your own projects.
